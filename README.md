# Weather Forecast Application üå§Ô∏è

This project is a Vue 3 application that provides weather forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application supports both light and dark themes and allows the user to toggle between them. The weather data is dynamically fetched based on the user's location, which is determined via the browser's geolocation API.

## Features

- üåç **Geolocation-Based Weather**: Automatically fetches weather data based on the user's location.
- üåê **Multi-Language Support**: Displays weather information in Russian or English depending on the user's locale.
- üåô **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes using a stylish Flowbite-based switch.
- üèô **City-Based Weather Data**: Allows users to see weather data specific to their city.
- üîÑ **Reactive Updates**: Weather data is automatically refreshed when the user's city or language preference changes.
